# Number-Guessing-Game

Developing a number guessing game in JavaScript offered a practical educational opportunity encompassing essential programming principles. At first, it was important to understand the syntax of JavaScript, which includes variables and functions. Making use of if-else statements made it easier to provide feedback depending on the user's guesses. Using loops ensured that the game would continue to repeat until the user either guessed the number correctly or chose to stop playing. Engaging with users via prompts or alerts improved comprehension of user input and output systems. Generating a number for guessing was primarily done through random number generation, typically using `Math.random()`. Dealing with errors focused on cases of incorrect user input, enhancing the system's strength. Providing feedback on the user's predictions, like identifying whether the prediction was too high, too low, or accurate, increased involvement. Thorough testing and debugging guaranteed the game worked as planned. Certain developers may have prioritized improving the game's appearance and user interface by working on the styling aspect. Writing down the code and maybe sharing it helped to solidify understanding and receive possible input from colleagues. In general, this project led to the creation of an enjoyable game while also enhancing comprehension of JavaScript basics relevant to wider programming scenarios.
